# Recursive algorithm

It is an algorithm which calls itself with smaller (or simpler) input values, and which obtains the result for the current input by applying simple operations to the returned value for the smaller input.
More generally if a problem can be solved utilizing solutions to smaller versions of the same problem, and the smaller versions reduce to easily solvable cases, then one can use a recursive algorithm to solve that problem.
